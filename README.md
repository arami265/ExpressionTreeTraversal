# ExpressionTreeTraversal


Originally written in C++ in 2014 for CSCI 3333: Algorithms and Data Structures at UT Rio Grande Valley; now converted to Java.

This code builds an expression tree from an expression and conducts preorder and postorder traversal.

It currently has the basic functionality of generating an expression tree from an input of infix notation, and calculating the output.

More versatile expression input and traversal steps need to be added.
